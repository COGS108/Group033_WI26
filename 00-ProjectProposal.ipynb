    "Using the ExtraSensory minute-level in-the-wild dataset, is social context (alone vs with_friends vs with_family) associated with the probability that a person is physically active in that same minute? We will define the outcome active_minute = 1 if any of the labels walking, running, or bicycling is present for that minute, and 0 otherwise. The main predictors will be the social labels (alone, with_friends, with_family), and we will adjust for confounds using time-of-day, day-of-week, holiday indicator, local weather (temperature and precipitation), and environment context (for example at_home, at_work, outside). We will estimate associations using a mixed-effects logistic regression with a participant random intercept to account for repeated measures within individuals. Primary metrics will be odds ratios and marginal probability differences between social contexts with ninety-five percent confidence intervals, plus sensitivity analyses using alternative definitions of active_minute.\n"

    "Physical activity is a core public-health behavior, but it is not only an individual choice—people’s activity levels are shaped by *context*, including **who they are with**. Social and behavioral research has repeatedly argued that social connection and support can influence whether people start and maintain physical activity, but the strength and direction of this relationship can vary depending on the *source* of the social influence (friends versus family) and the situation.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) This motivates our focus on separating `with_friends` and `with_family` rather than treating “being social” as one generic category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work also suggests that **friends and family are not interchangeable** in how they relate to physical activity. For example, Larsen et al. explicitly examined differences between **family integration** and **friend integration** and their association with physical activity, treating them as distinct social dimensions rather than one combined predictor.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Similarly, Sarkar et al. compared different sources of social support (family, friends, coworkers) and analyzed how these relate to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, reinforcing the idea that the “type” of social context matters for activity outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) These studies support our project design choice: we will estimate separate associations for `with_friends` and `with_family` relative to `alone`.\n",

    "However, much of the behavioral literature relies on surveys, retrospective recall, or diaries, which can miss the fine-grained, moment-to-moment nature of daily behavior. Time-diary approaches like the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) are valuable because they record what people did and also include “with whom” context, enabling large-scale analyses of social context and activity patterns across the population.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) For example, Sener et al. used ATUS to examine the timing, location, duration, and **social context** of physically active behavior, demonstrating that the “with whom” dimension is a meaningful lens for understanding activity in real life.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5) These diary-based results motivate our project’s external-validity strategy: use an in-the-wild sensing dataset for minute-level inference, and use diary evidence as a broader contextual check.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the data science side, mobile and wearable sensing offers a way to study behavior in natural settings—but it is difficult because real-world behavior is unscripted and phone usage is unconstrained. The ExtraSensory project directly addresses this by providing a large-scale **in-the-wild** dataset with minute-level, multi-label context annotations (including social context labels) paired with smartphone/smartwatch sensor data, specifically designed to study detailed human context outside the lab.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a>[<sup>6</sup>](#cite_note-6) Because ExtraSensory includes both social labels and activity labels at the same time resolution, it enables our proposed **statistical inference** approach: estimating the association between being with friends or family and the likelihood of being active, while controlling for time structure and environment. Our work therefore connects behavior-science theory (social context matters) with a measurement approach suited to real life (minute-level in-the-wild context labels), and aims to quantify whether the association holds after adjustment for major confounds.\n",

    "\n",
    "The ideal dataset would be minute-level repeated measures for a large sample of people, where each row represents (participant_id, timestamp_minute) and includes: (1) social context with clear categories (alone / with friends / with family), (2) a validated physical activity measure per minute (for example step count or energy expenditure from a wearable), (3) environment context (home/work/outdoors/transit), and (4) time variables (time-of-day, day-of-week, date). It would also include major confounders like weather (temperature/precipitation) and a holiday indicator, plus participant-level demographics and device-compliance flags. To estimate within-person associations reliably, we would aim for at least 100+ participants with 2–4 weeks of data each (millions of minute-observations total), collected in-the-wild using smartphones/wearables plus low-burden ecological momentary assessment for “who are you with.” Data would be stored as a tidy minute-level table plus a participant metadata table, with explicit missingness indicators for any absent labels or sensors.\n",

    "B) American Time Use Survey (ATUS) (secondary dataset: external validity / triangulation)\n",
    "Where located / access: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ATUS portal + documentation: https://www.bls.gov/tus/ (publicly available microdata and user guides).\n",
    "Important variables we would use: time-diary “episodes” with activity codes (to identify physical activity/exercise), time-of-day/date, and “with whom” context fields (to operationalize alone vs with others; where possible, family vs non-family).\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: We are not collecting data from participants ourselves. If the dataset contains human-related records, we will only use sources that were collected by the original providers under their stated terms of use and consent processes. We will not attempt to re-identify individuals or merge in additional data to identify people.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: This is relevant because observational/public datasets often over-represent certain groups, locations, or time periods. We will inspect basic distributions (for example, geography, time, or demographic proxies if present) and explicitly discuss how any skews could affect conclusions. If strong imbalance exists, we will use appropriate stratified evaluation and avoid making “population-wide” claims.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: This is relevant. We will not use direct identifiers (names, exact addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, student identifiers, account identifiers). If any appear, we will drop them immediately and ensure no outputs contain row-level information that could identify an individual. We will only report aggregated results and summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: If protected attributes are present, we will be cautious about how they are used (for example, not using them as targets or as proxies for targeting). If protected attributes are not present, we will still consider proxy variables (for example, ZIP code as a proxy for race/income) and discuss this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: We will keep data in our private course repository / local machines with restricted access to team members only. If the dataset includes any sensitive fields, we will store only the minimum needed columns, avoid sharing raw data in public locations, and avoid uploading raw files outside the class workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Not applicable for our use if the dataset is fully public, de-identified, and we do not maintain a system of individual accounts or records. If we discover the dataset includes identifiable records, we will not use it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: We will delete local copies of any raw data after the course ends (or earlier if no longer needed), keeping only derived, non-identifying aggregates and our code/notebooks for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: This can be relevant because our interpretation could miss context about how the data were generated. We will cross-check assumptions against documentation and at least one external source (for example, official data dictionary / methodology notes), and we will describe what perspectives are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: This is relevant. We will check for missingness patterns, imbalanced classes, and potential confounds. Where possible we will run sensitivity checks (for example, compare results across subgroups or time periods) and clearly state when results may be driven by bias or confounding.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: We will avoid misleading visuals (for example, truncated axes, cherry-picked time windows) and will present uncertainty (confidence intervals / variability) when appropriate. We will report both overall and subgroup performance if modeling is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: We will not publish raw records, and we will avoid showing small-cell counts that could enable re-identification. Any examples shown will be synthetic or heavily aggregated.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: We will keep a clear, reproducible pipeline (data cleaning steps, feature engineering, modeling code, and random seeds), and we will document decisions so issues can be traced later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: If we build predictive models, we will review features for potential proxies for protected characteristics and avoid using features that create discriminatory outcomes without strong justification.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: If group labels exist (or reasonable proxies), we will compare error rates across groups. If they do not exist, we will note that fairness testing is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: We will not rely on a single metric. For classification, we will report multiple metrics (for example, precision, recall, and calibration where relevant) and justify the metric choice based on the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: We will prefer interpretable baselines (for example, linear/logistic models) and use feature importance or partial dependence plots if we use more complex models, so our conclusions can be explained.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: We will clearly describe limitations (data coverage, bias, confounding, and generalizability) and avoid overstating claims (especially causal claims from correlational data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Not applicable because we are not deploying a system in production.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Not applicable because we are not deploying a system that affects users directly.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Not applicable because we are not deploying.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: This is relevant. Even an academic model/analysis could be misused (for example, to profile or target groups). We will frame results as exploratory/educational, avoid providing “actionable targeting” recommendations, and emphasize appropriate use boundaries in our final report.\n"
